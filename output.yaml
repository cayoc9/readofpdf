- AVALIAÇÃO: Provides valuable insights into the effects of climate change on agriculture
    in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly among smallholder farmers. Could be improved
    by expanding the geographical scope and incorporating more qualitative data to
    gain a more comprehensive understanding of the issue.
  CONCLUSÃO: The urgent need for policymakers to address the impacts of climate change
    on agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa is highlighted. Recommendations include improving
    access to climate information, supporting the development and dissemination of
    climate-resilient agricultural practices, and investing in infrastructure to mitigate
    the effects of extreme weather events.
  DATASET:
  - Weather stations data from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with
    Station (CHIRPS) dataset.
  - Farm-level data from the Agriculture and Food Security Information System (AFRIS).
  - Interviews conducted with smallholder farmers in selected regions of sub-Saharan
    Africa.
  FUTURO: Expand the geographical scope of studies on this topic, incorporate more
    qualitative data from a diverse range of smallholder farmers, and develop models
    that can predict climate change impacts with higher precision.
  GAP: Despite extensive research on climate change and its effects globally, there
    is a gap in understanding the specific impacts of climate change on agriculture
    in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly among smallholder farmers.
  LIMITAÇÕES: Limited scale of analysis, as it focuses on specific regions within
    sub-Saharan Africa. The use of weather station data may not fully capture localized
    climate variability.
  METODOLOGIA: Literature review, case studies from selected regions in sub-Saharan
    Africa, quantitative analysis of weather data, and qualitative analysis of farmer
    interviews. Statistical methods were employed to analyze the data, and thematic
    analysis was used for the qualitative data.
  OBJETIVOS:
  - Analyze the impact of climate change on agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa, with
    a specific focus on smallholder farmers.
  - Identify vulnerable areas.
  - Assess adaptation strategies.
  - Provide recommendations for policymakers.
  RESULTADOS: Significant decreases in precipitation and increases in temperature
    in some regions of sub-Saharan Africa, leading to crop failures. Smallholder farmers
    are adapting through techniques such as changing planting times and crops. However,
    these adaptation strategies may not be enough to counteract the effects of climate
    change.
